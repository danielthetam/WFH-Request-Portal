WFH(Work From Home) Request Portal Application

A CRUD app utilising open source technologies including PostgreSQL, SpringBoot and ReactJS. ReactJS application has two pages, "http://localhost:3000" and "http://localhost:3000/admin". First is a page where you can submit a request to work from home through filling a form with a nice interactive UI, and second is an admin page where you can review each form. The React application interacts with a RESTful API created with SpringBoot which exposes API calls that interact with the PostgreSQL database.
